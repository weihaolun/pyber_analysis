# PyBer Challenge with Matplotlib

## I. Overview

### Background
We have been assisting PyBer, a Python based ride sharing app company performing an exploratory analysis on their internal data. We have received two CSV files:
1.	city_data.csv: includes 120 cities, number of drivers in each city and the type (urban, suburban, or rural) of the city.
2.	ride_data.csv: contains information of 2375 rides, including the city, date, fare, and the ride ID.
We conducted flowing analysis to prepare this part of project:
-	Inspect and merge DataFrames.
-	Create a bubble chart to show the average fare versus the total number of rides with bubble size based on the total number of drivers for each city type, including urban, suburban, and rural.
-	Summary statistics of measurements of central tendency (mean, median and mode) for:
    - The total number of rides for each city type.
    - The average fares for each city type.
    - The total number of drivers for each city type.
-	Created box-and-whisker plot to determine if there are any outliers for:
    - The number of rides for each city type.
    - The fares for each city type.
    - The number of drivers for each city type.
-	Created pie charts to visualize the following data for each city type:
    - The percent of total fares.
    - The percent of total rides.
    - The percent of total drivers.

### Purpose
The purpose of this challenge is to further analyze the performance among urban, suburban, and rural city types. Eventually, the goal is to:
  1.	Generate a Summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type;
  2.	Then use Pandas and Matplotlib to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total fares for each city type by week (from January to April 2019).
We will use above deliverables to analyze and summarize how the performance differs by three city types. In addition, we will provide three business advices according to the analysis at the end of this report.

## II. Results
_Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types._
  - **Total Rides**
  - **Total Drivers**
  - **Total Fares**
  - **Average Fare per Ride**
  - **Average Fare per Driver**
  - **Total Fare by City Type**
  
## III. Summary
_Three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types._
 1. 1
 2. 2
 3. 3
